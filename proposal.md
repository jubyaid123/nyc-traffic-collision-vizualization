## **Project Title**
**Analyzing Multivariate Factors Influencing Traffic Collision Severity in NYC**

---

## **Abstract**
Traffic collisions in New York City occur under a wide range of conditions involving different times of day, vehicle types, street locations, and contributing factors. Understanding how these variables interact can help identify patterns that lead to higher injury or fatality rates. This project aims to explore the complex, multivariate relationships behind traffic collisions using an interactive visualization dashboard.

Using the NYPD Motor Vehicle Collisions dataset, we will examine how temporal, spatial, and vehicle-related features correlate with collision severity and frequency. Our dashboard will enable users to filter by factors such as location, injury severity, time of day, and vehicle type to uncover meaningful trends. By providing an interactive analytical tool, this project seeks to highlight critical risk patterns and offer insights valuable to city officials, transportation planners, and the general public.

## **Project Question**
**How do time of day, location, vehicle type, and contributing factors interact to affect the severity and frequency of traffic collisions in New York City?**

---

## **Dataset**
We will use the following publicly available dataset:

**NYPD Motor Vehicle Collisions**  
Source: NYC Open Data  
Link: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Motor-Vehicle-Collisions/h9gi-nx95  

This dataset contains:
- Millions of records (satisfies the medium-large requirement)  
- 30+ attributes, including:  
  - Crash date and time  
  - Borough and geographic coordinates  
  - Contributing factors  
  - Vehicle types  
  - Number of injuries and fatalities  

This dataset is real, multivariate, and rich enough to support meaningful exploration.
